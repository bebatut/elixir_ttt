title: ELIXIR Train the Trainer programme
---

One of the ELIXIR Training Platform's objectives is to increase bioinformatics capacity and competency in Europe. This programme relies in the development of new courses and materials, and also specifically in the Train the Trainer (TtT) programme. 

The ELIXIR TtT programme aims to build a network of trainers to allow them to benefit from reciprocal support and discussion. ELIXIR TtT courses aim to give new instructors tools and tips for providing an enriching learning experience to trainees, irrespective of topic, and to include best-practice guidance on course and training material development. 

Four core topics form the basis the ELIXIR TtT course structure:

1. Principles of learning and how they apply to training;
2. Training techniques for enhancing learner engagement and participation,
3. Design of engaging sessions, materials and courses;
4. Assessment and feedback in training.
